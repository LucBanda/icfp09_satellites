# icfp09_satellites

This is my solution to icfp contest 2009.

documentation of the contest can be found [here](https://github.com/LucBanda/icfp09_satellites/blob/master/doc/icfp.pdf)

I rewrote it 10 years later with a genetic algorithm with better results

**compilation:**

in ./vm repository:

cmake .

make



**usage**

optimize *pb_number*    use genetic algorithm to find the best solution to *pb_number*

vm *pb_number*          visualize latest solution of the given *pb_number*

*pb_number* ranges in [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, 4001, 4002, 4003, 4004]


the project depends on C++11 and allegro5

tested on osx
